add concept of unit systems, such as SI vs imperial
    * update `convert` function to accept a system as a target
    * support forward references in System definition/registration

IDEAS

simplify/consolidate code with Vector operations
add support for dimensionless scalar types (e.g. Mol)
add support for angles
add support for 
make it easier to express quantities of complex types (such as "4 m/s")
unit aliases
add unit parsing.  i.e. recognize "m/s" as "meters per second"
add concept of tags for distinguishing semantically different types of the same dimensions, such work (F.d) and torque (r x F)
